# Figures and Simulation Analysis Script

This directory contains the figures generated from the simulations located in `../3_Simulations`, along with a script for post-simulation analysis and comparison of the simulated experiments.

## `PostSimAnalysis_Agricontrol.py`

This script performs the following tasks:
- Computes the performance metrics for the two simulated experiments, as described in Section 5 of [1].
- Generates Figure 3 from [1], which visualizes the results of the comparative analysis.
