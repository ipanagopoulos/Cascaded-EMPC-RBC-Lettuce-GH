This directory contains the simulation scripts used to produce the results presented in [1].

### Directory Structure

- **`1_InputData`**  
  Contains input files used for modeling and simulation purposes.

- **`2_Models`**  
  Includes Python functions for the lettuce model and numerical integration methods.

- **`3_Simulations`**  
  Contains simulation scripts used to generate the results presented in [1].

- **`4_OutputData`**  
  Stores the output data from two simulated experiments: Integrated ENMPC and Cascaded EMPC with RBC.

- **`5_PostSimAnalysis`**  
  Includes post-simulation analysis scripts and figure-generation code, based on the simulation results in `3_Simulations`.

Each folder contains a README or relevant documentation for further details.

To reproduce the results presented in the paper, run the appropriate Python scripts located in the `3_Simulations` folder.
